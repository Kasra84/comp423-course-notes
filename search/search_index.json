Think of it as a \"mini computer\" inside your computer, configured specifically for Go development.</p> <p>Why is this valuable? In software development, mismatched environments can lead to bugs and wasted time. A dev container eliminates the \"it works on my machine\" problem, ensuring everyone on a team has an identical setup. It also simplifies onboarding by letting new team members start working with minimal setup.</p> <p>For this tutorial, we will configure a dev container for Go development, ensuring we have the correct Go version and necessary tools.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/go-setup/#step-1-add-development-container-configuration","title":"Step 1.
